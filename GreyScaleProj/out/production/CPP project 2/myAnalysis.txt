Prompt: Try and apply the work-span model to your design;
 what sort of speedup should we expect if we move to a machine with P cores?
 Are there limits to the speedup we can observe? Does reality match expectations?
 Write up your analysis and results and hand them in along with the program.


 Response:
 The serial program and Parallel program ran at differing times. With a work span model design, The speedup we should see with P cores
 should give us some linear speedup.There are going to be limits to the speed up that we observe.
 The reason being is the same amount of work is being done across these P workers. Speed up will be no greater than P.
 Without an increase of work there should be speedup, but because we're on a Java virtual machine there are limits.
 The limits also come from teh ability to only have P cores and limited workers on those cores.
 My reality did not match my predictions. I did not experience any linear speedup.
 In fact, My serializable runs faster than my parallel one. However by changing my threshold for my threads and recursive action and changing
 number of threads in my forkJoinPool did show slight improvement over past versions of my forkJoinPool class.
 The reason it does not run faster is due to what is being parallelized in my methods.
